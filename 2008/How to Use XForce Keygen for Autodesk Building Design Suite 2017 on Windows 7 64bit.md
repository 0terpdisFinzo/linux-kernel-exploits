## What is X-Force Keygen?
  
X-Force Keygen is a software that can generate product keys for Autodesk products, such as Building Design Suite 2017. A product key is required when you install an Autodesk product as a point product or from a product suite. It helps to distinguish different product packages and to verify the authenticity of the software.
  
X-Force Keygen is not an official Autodesk product, and it is not endorsed or supported by Autodesk. It is a jailbreak software that can bypass the activation process of Autodesk products. Using X-Force Keygen may violate the terms of use of Autodesk products and may expose your system to security risks. Therefore, we do not recommend using X-Force Keygen for any purpose.
